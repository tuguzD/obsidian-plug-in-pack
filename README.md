# 📦 “Plug-in-pack” for 💜[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) app

This is just a large collection of already set up plugins and hotkeys… That was crafted to be flawlessly used without ~~almost~~ any conflicts.

> [!NOTE]
> After using the template to create your own vault, feel free to give this file a proper use:
> - describe your future work, motivation and goals…
> - as well as other important info other users need to know =)

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to create your own vault (to store your work there), and then update it with new changes from this pack...
> Please, ***DO NOT FORK*** this repository!
>
> You cannot change visibility of forked repositories on `GitHub`, so any of yours will stay **public** forever.
>
> Instead, you should use this repository as template or clone it (creating unrelated one) and then, if necessary, pull data from this one using these `Git` commands (in your console/terminal), according to the [source](https://gist.github.com/krlozadan/4b75255b88d7a1504e5e632cb817c3f5):
> ```
> git remote add plug-in-pack https://github.com/tuguzD/obsidian-plug-in-pack.git
> git pull -X theirs plug-in-pack main --allow-unrelated-histories --no-tags --no-commit
> git reset HEAD
> git remote remove plug-in-pack
> ```
> For other **important** notes for `Git` users, follow [here](#-synchronization).
> 

## 🔌 *Manage plugins* much easier

> [!TIP]
> Please, don't be afraid of large amounts of plugins here! There is ***139*** of them, to be exact!
>
> They are all organized in `groups` and each of them have a `tag` assigned – you can enable them personally or by groups “in bulk” using commands.
