# 🚞 Use plugins on various devices

Due to [Better Plugins Manager](https://github.com/0011000000110010/obsidian-manager) plugin not being able to work on [some devices](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Use+the+mobile+app), there are some differences in working with plugins depending on your current one:

- on 💻[Desktop](https://obsidian.md) (`Windows` / `Mac` / `Linux`), loading is controlled by [Better Plugins Manager](https://github.com/0011000000110010/obsidian-manager)
  - choosing right delay is generally harder, as the app does not track startup time correctly
  - but the result is slightly faster, while allowing toggling lots of plugins “in bulk” (to quickly change work modes)
- on 📱[Mobile](https://obsidian.md/mobile) (`Android` / `iOS`), plugin load/delay is controlled by [Lazy Plugin Loader](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-lazy-plugins)
  - you cannot use features related to groups/tags, as well as toggle them using commands,
  - but you generally need less plugins on a less powerful machine

> [!IMPORTANT]
> But how is that really done, technically speaking?
>
> Firstly, [Lazy Plugin Loader](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-lazy-plugins) launches and then determines user’s device type:
> - if it’s a `Desktop`, just the [Better Plugins Manager](https://github.com/0011000000110010/obsidian-manager) plugin is instantly launched (with global/desktop configuration), that then will launch all other ones (with a delay) on its own using its settings,
>
> - if it isn‘t, then the mobile configuration is chosen, and all other plugins will be loaded using [Lazy Plugin Loader](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-lazy-plugins) settings.

# 📑 Simplify your work with [Git](https://git-scm.com)

> [!TIP]
> All `Git` commands can be called directly from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) app with [Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) plugin command: `Git: Raw command`.
>
> On the other hand, they can’t be called ”in bulk” this way, so it’s suggested to work from system terminal.

## 🔄️ Pulling changes from “[Plug-in-pack](<./README.md>)” template

If you want to update your own repository (containing your vault and work) with **remote changes** from this one, you can pull all of them using these `Git` commands (in your terminal) in succession, according to [source](https://gist.github.com/krlozadan/4b75255b88d7a1504e5e632cb817c3f5):

```shell title="➕ Get changes from template remote (no history)" frame="code" showLineNumbers wrap
git remote add plug-in-pack "https://github.com/tuguzD/obsidian-plug-in-pack.git"
git pull -X theirs plug-in-pack main --allow-unrelated-histories --no-tags --no-commit --no-rebase
git reset HEAD
git remote remove plug-in-pack
```

Alternatively, you can just call the custom command from the [Status bar](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Status+bar) (or hide it with [Status Bar Organizer](https://github.com/Opisek/obsidian-statusbar-organizer)):

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that for all above to actually work (and not fail silently), your vault should not contain any uncommited changes to files that are pulled from this (remote) repository.
>
> So, you should either commit or discard YOUR changes to avoid encountering any unecessary issues.

After that, review and discard any changes you don’t need in ”`Source Control`” tab of the above-mentioned [Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) plugin (you can always open it via `Git: Open source control view` command).

## 🗑️ Ignoring changes to files without removing them

As you could’ve already noticed, some files seem to update each time the vault opens, so they have a potential to clutter each commit with meaningless changes.

Changes for such files can be ignored locally, for each of your device (but not for the whole repository, like when using `.gitignore`) by updating each file’s index using [skip-worktree bit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index#_skip_worktree_bit). I suggest you to avoid updating files below by running these `Git` commands:

```shell title="🫥 Don't collect changes from these files" frame="code" showLineNumbers wrap
git update-index --skip-worktree ".obsidian\plugins\media-notes\data.json"
git update-index --skip-worktree ".obsidian\plugins\novel-word-count\data.json"
git update-index --skip-worktree ".obsidian\plugins\enhanced-annotations\data.json"
git update-index --skip-worktree ".obsidian\plugins\obsidian-day-and-night\data.json"
git update-index --skip-worktree ".obsidian\plugins\enhanced-symbols-prettifier\data.json"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Of course, all of these files can be deleted from the repository, and then added to `.gitignore` file (if you so desire) – this way, they won’t be present in it anymore.
>
> But I (personally) think that some of these files still provide useful configurations that should not be deleted, as they won’t be shared to all the users of this “[Plug-in-pack](<#-plug-in-pack-for-obsidian-app>)” template.

Also, similar commands can be used for some of your own configurations that you’ll want to be already set up for each new device (that’ll receive local copy of the vault), but don’t want to be changed thereafter.
